    "# BackProjection\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the range-Doppler and polar format alogirthms, backprojection does not need to make as many assumptions, such as about cell migration or platform motion. Its implementation is basically the same regardless of the imaging method. Backprojection also forms images in the ground plane, which makes orthorectification and registration easier and more efficient."
