    "# The Range Doppler Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The range-Doppler algorithm (RDA) is one of the most widely used image formation algorithms for Synthetic Aperture Radar. It is the primary image formation algorithm used by [GAMMA Software](https://gamma-rs.ch/uploads/media/GAMMA_Software_information.pdf), for example. RDA handles the range and azimuth domains, seperately, as one-dimensional processes. Separately handling the range and azimuth domains is an approximation that leads to errors. These errors must be corrected through *range cell migration correction* (RCMC)."

Because of this, the signal can cross multiple range cells; these range cells must be aligned by using RCMC or the final image will be blurred."

    "Range cell migration correction is needed to ensure that range cells are aligned after converting to the range-Doppler domain. Before this can be done, the Doppler Centroid must be accurately estimated. Any errors in the Doppler centroid estimation will translate to poor SNR, ambiguity, among other problems. One technique for Doppler centroid estimation is the average phase change method. The average phase change method finds the mean of the phase change between adjacent azimuth cells for each range cell. This process is given by\n",
