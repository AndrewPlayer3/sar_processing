    "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an imaging technique that is capable of generating high-resolution images in all weather conditions. SAR imaging modes usually operate using a moving platform with a side-looking geometry. Radar pulses are emitted as the platform moves, and the motion is used to form a *synthetic aperture*. The received pulses are then combined to form an image. The pulses are usually *linear frequency modulated (LFM)* waveforms, which are also known as *chirps*. In SAR geometry, there are two different kinds of \"time\": fast time and slow time. *Fast time* is the time related to the pulses. *Slow time* is the time related to the motion of the platform. Unlike most imaging, SAR data needs to be processed to be interpretable. The form of the raw data changes depending on the exact platform and implementation. There are also many different ways of forming a SAR image.\n",

    "Stripmap imaging was the first imaging mode used in SAR systems. Generally, as the platform moves, it points at a fixed look angle $\\theta_l$ illuminates a section of the ground called the *ground swath*. The illumination is done via a continuous sequence of pulses, and the shape of the ground swath is usually an ellipse. The ellipse moves across the ground in the direction of the platforms motion, which is known as the *cross range* direction.\n",
